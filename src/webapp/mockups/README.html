<h3>UI Development</h3>

<p>
Place files in here that are being developed for mock-ups. Organize
them however you like; nothing here gets deployed to the web server.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
make all pages XML (tags balanced, lower-case, etc.)
</li>
<li>
you can develop pages within this hierarchy, creating
local image, css and js directories if you want.
</li>
<li>
Use "java-friendly" names for input fields. These start with
a lowercase letter and use initial caps within. For example,
"userEmailAddress" or "subscriptionNumber".
</li>
<li>use "id" on any significant element. Follow the "java-friendly"
convention above. This will make java coding and testing easier.
</li>
</ol>



<h3>Push to Site</h3>

<p>
Files that are ready to go should following these conventions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>put images, javascripts and other required resources in
the appropriate folders parallel to this directory. Therefore,
use webapp/images and webapp/js and webapp/css.

</li>
<li>
use the <base> tag to point to the "webapp" folder

</li>
<li>
make sure it looks right in this context.

</li>

</ol>
<p>

Til is responsible for getting all the resources into the right
folders outside of this folder.
   </p>
   <p>
Programmers will be responsible for moving the Html page. Be
aware that this may involve breaking up the page
into components.
