<h3>UI Development</h3>

<p>
Place files in here that are being developed for mock-ups. Organize
them however you like; nothing here gets deployed to the web server.
</p>
<p>
Keep in mind:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
make all pages XML (tags balanced, lower-case, etc.)
</li>
<li>
Til, you can develop pages within this hierarchy, creating
local image, css and js directories if you want.
</li>
<li>
Use "java-friendly" names for input fields. These start with
a lowercase letter and use initial caps within. For example,
"userEmailAddress" or "subscriptionNumber". These will probably
get changed when we merge the file into Java.
</li>
<li>use "id" on any significant element. Follow the "java-friendly"
convention above. This will make java coding and testing easier.
</li>
</ol>



<h3>Push to Site</h3>

<p>
Files that are ready to go should following these conventions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>put images, javascripts and other required resources in
the appropriate folders inside the "webapp/res" folder,
parallel to this directory. Therefore,
use webapp/res/img and webapp/res/js and webapp/res/css.

</li>
<li>
use the <base> tag to point to the "webapp" folder to make
sure your page works. See verisign1.htm to see it work.

</li>
<li>
make sure it looks right in this context.
</li>
<li>
tell the programmer it's ready to go.
</li>

</ol>
<p>
Til is responsible for getting all the resources into the right
folders outside of this folder.
Programmers will be responsible for moving the Html page into the
Java context. Be
aware that this may involve breaking up the page
into components.
