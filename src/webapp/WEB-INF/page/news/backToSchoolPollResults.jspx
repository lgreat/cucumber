                In a groundbreaking new study titled "The Economy's Impact on Back to School,"
                GreatSchools and Harris Interactive find that parents, worried about the economy and education
                cutbacks, are planning to pitch in with greater volunteerism and shop smarter for school supplies.
                Many are also reconsidering what type of school their kids should attend.

            <h3>1. Planned parent volunteerism at school is up 20%</h3>
            
            <p>
                In the context of current economic challenges, nearly two in three parents (64%) believe it is
                more important for them to volunteer at school now than before. A majority of parents (53%)
                plan to volunteer at their children's schools this year versus 44% last year &amp;mdash; <b>an increase
                of 20%</b>. This trend is <b>most pronounced among African American parents</b>, 60% of whom plan to
                volunteer (up from 23% who say they volunteered last year).
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite their strong interest in volunteering, however, <b>parents may still remain an
                untapped resource</b>. According to the report, nearly half (49%) list the <b>lack of opportunities
                offered by teachers or schools</b> among the main challenges they face to being more involved
                in their children's education. 
            </p>

            <p class="takeaway">
                A majority of parents agree that it's more important to volunteer at school,
                but they may not know how best to help.

            <h3>2. Parents are concerned about school cutbacks, and some are rethinking school choices</h3>

            <p>
                More than three in five parents (61%) believe <b>the quality of education will suffer because
                of school cutbacks</b>. Regardless of whether their children now attend public or private school,
                nearly one in four parents (24%) are <b>rethinking the type of school their children should
                attend</b> going forward. This trend is most prominent among lower-income urban and suburban parents.
            </p>

            <p class="takeaway">
                Lack of education confidence and parents rethinking their children's school options are part of
                the backdrop of a challenging economic environment.

            <p>
                Parents' best intentions do not always translate into best practices. Three-quarters or more make
                logistical plans &amp;mdash; 93% plan to shop for school supplies &amp;mdash; but <b>fewer than half
                focus on academics or reducing distractions</b> for their children. Only 47% find out which subjects
                their children will be learning, 39% have their kids start reading more often, and 33% cut down
                on TV and video games.  Parents of older kids, as well as black and urban parents, say they do
                more of these preparatory activities before the first day of school.

                Most parents (74%) expect their economic situation to worsen or stay the same in the
                next six months. As a result, nearly 9 in 10 parents (88%) plan to take <b>cost-saving
                steps when shopping for school supplies</b>, including reusing old supplies and delaying
                purchases until after school starts to only buy necessities.

            <p class="takeaway">

            Six months since President Barack Obama urged Americans to volunteer in their communities, a new report suggests that some parents may be taking his message to heart.   According to a survey of more than 1000 parents from GreatSchools and Harris Interactive, this year parents plan to increase their volunteering in their children's schools by 20%.  "The Economy's Impact on Back to School" also found that 64% of parents believe that it is more important to volunteer now than before.
