        <h3>GreatSchools Editorial and Advertising Policy</h3>

        <p>GreatSchools.org has a strict policy of separation between editorial and advertising content.
            We do not allow advertisers to influence our editorial content.</p>

        <p>We believe you should always know the source of the information you're reading, and we will not accept
            advertisements that we think are misleading. All advertising is either clearly separated from editorial
            content or clearly labeled "advertisement" or "from our sponsors."</p>

        <p>Pharmaceutical advertising to consumers must comply with FDA guidelines on direct-to- consumer advertising.
            GreatSchools will not monitor compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but we reserve the right to
            review all advertising for compliance. If GreatSchools becomes aware of any breach or potential breach of
            any applicable law or regulation or of these guidelines, we may remove the advertising.</p>

        <p>We reserve the right to reject an ad based on its appropriateness to our parent audience.</p>
