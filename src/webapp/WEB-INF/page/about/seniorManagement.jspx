                            belt, David most recently worked at Adobe Systems as director of Web Services.
                            David graduated from the University of Bristol with a degree in computer
                            science. In his final year there, he designed a computer system to help
                            children learn to read which was commissioned by a local elementary school.
                            David credits his years at the Royal Grammar School in Newcastle-upon-Tyne
                            for exposing him to a wide range of musical, practical and sporting
                            experiences, and for his deep-seated dislike of cricket.
