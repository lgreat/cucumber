                            As a teacher in the U.S. and China in the late 1980s, Bill came to recognize
                            the extraordinary influence that parents have over their children's
                            education. Then, as an Internet entrepreneur in the 1990s, he recognized
                            the extraordinary potential of the Internet as a communications medium to
                            engage and support parents. He founded GreatSchools in 1998 to tap the
                            power of this new medium to help parents be more effectively involved in
                            their children's education. An avid school volunteer, Bill is a member of
                            the California P-16 Council and serves as secretary of the Parent
                            Association Council at Chinese American International School and a
                            volunteer at Miraloma Elementary School. He has also served as a director
                            of the San Francisco Education Fund and as treasurer for two San Francisco
                            school financing measures and a school board campaign. Bill holds a degree
                            in mechanical engineering from Yale University and is a graduate of the
                            San Francisco Coro Fellows Program. As the former president of the

                            belt, David most recently worked at Adobe Systems as Director of Web Services.
                            David graduated from the University of Bristol with a degree in computer
                            science. In his final year there, he designed a computer system to help
                            children learn to read which was commissioned by a local elementary school.
                            David credits his years at the Royal Grammar School in Newcastle-upon-Tyne
                            for exposing him to a wide range of musical, practical and sporting
                            experiences, and for his deep-seated dislike of cricket.
