&quot;Teachers are awesome! The curriculum is state of the art. There is a nice 'family' feel to this school. Everyone works together for the good of all students.&quot;

&quot;This was the best decision we've ever made for our family! The curriculum is outstanding. Do you, as a parent, need to spend 4-5 hrs. a day teaching and monitoring your child? OF COURSE YOU DO. The best part of 'home schooling' is quality family time. Now school is part of our life but it's not our entire day. We rarely have 'home work.' Our AZVA teacher has been more encouraging and supportive than any teacher we've ever had in regular public school.&quot;
