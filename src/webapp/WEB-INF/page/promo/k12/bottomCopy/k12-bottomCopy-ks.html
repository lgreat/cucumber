&quot;I enrolled my daughter for the 2008-2009 year. I believe our our local schools fail to meet the standards which must be met. My daughter loves LVS and the ability to move through a subject as fast or as slow as needed. So do I. The curriculum itself is wonderful. There is also great support from the Education Specialists. Student progress is tracked online daily. We could not be more pleased with what LVS has to offer when compared to a brick & mortar school. I am fascinated by the amount and quality of support we receive. The school books and other materials are up to date. I enjoy working with my daughter. I like to know what and how she is doing in school and with LVS this is possible. I highly recommend this school to other parents.&quot;

&quot;This school is GREAT! Really helps me stay on top of things. Provides almost all my materials at a very small cost. I also had an education specialist at my fingertips. I could call or email her at any time. And mine was TERRIFIC! This is the only way we will ever homeschool! I will never go back to traditional homeschooling. And it is very flexible for different children and different learning styles! It's just great!&quot;

&quot;This is an excellent school for home education. Your child is still a part of a public school, and yet it is a home schooling setting. I love the teachers and the curriculum. It is perfect and fits our needs. I would highly recommend this school.&quot;
