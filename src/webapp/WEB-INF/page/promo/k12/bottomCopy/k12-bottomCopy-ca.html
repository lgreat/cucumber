&quot;Our child is only in kindergarten and within 3 months of starting the program she learned how to read independently. She was bored when attending a traditional school. She was not being challenged. Now with CAVA, she gets to choose what subjects to study in any given order. She is more confident and she attends all the field trips. We have a great teacher that we can contact whenever we need help. CAVA is a great choice for homeschooling!&quot;

&quot;Deciding to take my two children ages 9 and 16 out of the public school system was my best decision in my life. CAVA has been such a blessing for my children. The curriculum has been outstanding, my children are now being challenged everyday. No more just sitting in class reading a book and having no teacher interaction. My son has excelled and has a better outlook about school. His self esteem and confidence has improved.&quot;

&quot;A great program where a child can excel in a normal high school curriculum without being in a traditional high school setting.&quot;
