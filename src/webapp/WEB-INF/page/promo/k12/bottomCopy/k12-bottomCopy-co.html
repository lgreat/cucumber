&quot;This is a great option for those who are fully committed to their child's education. The program is not rigorous - it just requires time. Just because your child is in the 5th grade, for example, doesn't mean that they don't need help. If that were the case there would be no need for teachers in public schools. If you have the time, you will see that your child is learning above the grade level of your local school. Like it was stated before by another review, this is not an option if you need a 'nanny school' aka someone to babysit your child while they learn so you can do other things. I have been with COVA for 3 years and I wouldn't have it any way!&quot;

&quot;Excellent curriculum provided by K12... all FREE! This IS the homeschool choice for the parent that feels overwhelmed just with the thought of taking on the challenge. COVA has everything to simplify the experience of making the homeschool choice... they provide qualified teachers to help support parent and student, administer state testing, and evaluate writing and math samples that the student is required to submit quarterly. COVA is fun, organized, supportive and just the BEST choice available to the homeschool family.&quot;

&quot;This is our first year with Colorado Virtual Academy (COVA) and we all love it! The website is user friendly and very interactive for my kindergartener. She is scoring high on all her benchmarks. We are very happy with our decision of homeschooling and working with COVA.&quot;
