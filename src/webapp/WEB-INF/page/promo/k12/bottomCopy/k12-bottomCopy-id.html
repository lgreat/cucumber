&quot;They have excellent curriculum and a supportive team to help your student and you. I recommend it for all grades. My students are so advanced because they can work a their own pace. My high schoolers will have college creits under their belt when that time comes. They are able to buckle down and concentrate o their studies without distractions that come fom a brick and mortar scholl. IDVA also as tons of activies including gym days at our local gym where they can swim and hang ut with their friends. It's a geat program and a great community and a great experience. I love it but more importantly, my kid LOVE it! Thank you IDVA!!!!&quot;

&quot;IDAHOVA.org is the best educational system for our child. The science, art, music, history included in the 3Rs are fabulous. There is no other public school in Idaho that includes these courses in Kindergarten and builds on these in each subsequent year. We've tried two other district school and were greatly disappointed in the weak cirriculum that they use. IDAHOVA is the best school in Idaho. The only way to learn so much in so many interesting ways.&quot;
