&quot;This is my first year with MNVA, but I have enjoyed the experience. We have a wonderful teacher - the same one for both our boys. She has been so helpful with everything. The work load is large for K and 1st grade, but I was prepared for that going into the school year. If you want to do well in MNVA you need to try and keep to the 4-5 hour-a-day work load. This is part of the agreement you sign when you start. If your family isn't able to work with that then maybe MNVA isn't for you. But do consider that the curriculum is high quality and their phonics program is wonderful! I think the hard work is worth it.&quot;

&quot;They have wonderful acedemic standards, that many times reach above 'traditional' public schools. The teachers are always there to help. We love this school.&quot;
