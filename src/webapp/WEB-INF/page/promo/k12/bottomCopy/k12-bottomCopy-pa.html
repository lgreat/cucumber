&quot;My daughter and I are really enjoying Agora. She is in sixth grade & attended a parochial school up until fifth grade, so this is our first year. Since she's a middle-schooler, she can read and do most assignments on her own, but I feel like I am much more involved in & aware of what she's learning, and am seeing deficiencies I may not have otherwise noticed had she continued in her traditional school setting. The teacher is helpful, & the school offers a variety of activities for kids to participate in, though I don't depend on those for socialization; I keep her involved in our parish activities & sports to fill that void. So far, we are having a great experience & she wants to continue at Agora for seventh grade.&quot;

&quot;This school has been a gem for my son. He is currently in the 11grade. This is his 3rd year at Agora. He has had the opportunity to participate in activities at Villanova in reference to leadership and the counselors were extremely helpful in getting him set up to take his PSATs at a local high school. The curriculm is challenging and he is never bored. The teachers are really helpful. If I was a stay at home mom I would be doing this for my younger child as well. Together my mom and I mentor my son. My mom is a retired teacher and she covers when my husband and I are at work.&quot;

&quot;A great school and I am so glad we chose it. Great teachers, great online classes and so easy to use. The parent must be involved in the childs education but that is why we chose Agora.&quot;
