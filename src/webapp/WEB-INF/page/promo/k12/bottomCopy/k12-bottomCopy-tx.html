&quot;My son has enjoyed his 9th grade year at this school. The curriculum is great and comparable to conventional schools.They have weekly class connects (which are a virtual classrooms, taught each week, in each major subject, with the teacher and other students attending). The science course had great experiments and was fun and a great learning experience. They also have wonderful teachers that are very supportive!&quot;

&quot;TXVA has been the best school my children have ever attended. They address my childrens special needs and the teachers are always there willing to help. I just want to thank the teachers of TXVA for going above and beyond for our children. THANKS TXVA!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;TXVA is wonderful. It is the perfect solution for families looking for an alternative to 'regular' schools. I love that my son is getting an education that meets (and exceeds!) state standards, has the support of a qualified teacher, and the one-on-one instruction with his learning coach. I tell everyone that will listen about TXVA!&quot;
