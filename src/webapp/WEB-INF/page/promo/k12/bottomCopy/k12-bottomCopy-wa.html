&quot;WAVA, is an excellent school for my child. She has more one on one learning time. A much bigger quality social life. Her Lessons are at her personal level of education tailored just for the student. There is no more standing on cold bus stops in the dark morning hours. to get to an over crowded school were you hope your child can learn something ,or even get to finish lunch before loosing there seat in the over crowded lunch room. I wish online public school was an option sooner. It may be the new way to go to school and replace the brick and mortar schools all together.&quot;

&quot;Washington Virtual Academy has been serving our family for the past four years and we are so very happy to be able to offer my son this quality academis program. The materials are up to date and beautiful and the teachers are outstanding. My son may have dropped out if we did not have this option because of the crime and dysfunction currently in the brick and mortor schools.&quot;

&quot;Outstanding program for your children! They are more attentive than any other public school we've had our kids in, even setting up and then exceeding the 504 Plan requirements when the public schools continue to ignore them. (My child is in the local school 1/2 time)&quot;
