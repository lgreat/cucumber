&quot;We have been involved with the K12 program in both Colorado and Wisconsin and have found it to be of the highest quality. It affords us the freedom to participate in our children's education while still being part of the state's standardized testing. The core curriculum gives our kids a great education that we have confidence in. The teachers and administrators that we have worked with have been extremely helpful and friendly and seem genuinely interested in our children's educational success. My wife and I would highly recommend this program to anyone who wants to homeschool their children.&quot;

&quot;This is our second year with WIVA and we love it! The curriculum is rigorous and includes art and music courses. The teachers and staff are very responsive to parents questions and their feedback. There are many opportunities for field trips and direct learning activities. This approach to education does require a big commitment from the student and family but the results are well worth it for our family!&quot;

&quot;My three children have benefited greatly from this program. The flexibility allows us to meet all of our children's needs. The partnership with the school is excellent. We would recommend this program for all parents and students.&quot;
