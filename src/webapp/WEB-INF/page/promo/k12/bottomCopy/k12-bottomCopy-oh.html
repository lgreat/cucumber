&quot;OHVA [Ohio Virtual Academy] has a great curriculum and wonderful teachers that are part of the learning process. K-8 students need to have one parent that is able to stay at home and help with lessons and the learning process. HS can be different and the students do work on their own and classes are lead by the various HS teachers. Parent are able to check on progress be part of the recording process. Social parts of the school such as outings and other gatherings have locations around in the state and more things are offered for K-8 than HS. This is a great program for the independent learner and for families that travel and want a schedule that is not 8:00 - 3:00.&quot;

&quot;I love the flexibility for the students to work at their own pace, the freedom associated with e-school, and the responsibility the kids learn from having a shared responsibility for their own schooling.&quot;

&quot;I absolutely love the K12 curriculum, especially history and language arts. OHVA provides families with more support than I ever dreamed we would have when we first started this adventure. The class connect sessions that are offered are phenomenal. All of our teachers have made themselves available for one-on-one time when my kids have come across more challenging areas. OHVA allows the freedom to be as independent as we desire, while providing the type of support our kids need to be successful learners.&quot;
