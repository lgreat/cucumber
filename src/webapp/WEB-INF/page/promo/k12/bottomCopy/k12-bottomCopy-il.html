&quot;CVCS offers curriculum from K12. What a gold mine! My two students enjoy their online classes and weekly virtual sessions with their teacher, as well as their weekly Learning Center day in a classroom setting with the same teacher. I can speak volumes for CVCS, the the proof is in the pudding ... my 6th grade student rated 95% in Reading and 92% in Math on the 2009 ISAT. We are now awaiting for 2010 ISAT test scores for 7th grade. My 5th grade student is no different. This student rated 91% in Reading and 93% in Math. Both scores from 2009 ISAT. This student too ... is awaiting the 2010 ISAT test scores of 6th grade. Just when you think there aren't any educational opportunities for your student to succeed ... there is CVCS. Three CHEERS for CVCS' curriculum !!!&quot;

&quot;CVCS is an excellent school. The staff is supportive and knowledgeable. Parents (learning coaches) are truly in charge of how successful there children can be in the school. Learning coaches help direct the path of their chid's education. The curriculum is interesting and challenging. No other school is Chicago (private or public) has as great a curriculum as CVCS. It is definitely a unique way of educating but for the betterment of your child. All children benefit from one on one teaching and your child will soar beyond your expectations.&quot;
