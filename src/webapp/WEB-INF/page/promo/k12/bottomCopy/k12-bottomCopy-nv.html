&quot;My Daughter is in Grade 8 and really likes NVVA. She is motivated by the curriculum and likes doing the work at her pace. She always has been a night owl and this works for her.&quot;

&quot;I love Nevada Virtual Academy because Administration and Teachers care so deeply about students success, and because we have supportive and involved parents that make a difference every day!&quot;

&quot;NVVA has the most cutting edge concept to education. It gives the power of educating children to their parents with the support of highly qualifed teachers. It's public school in the home.&quot;
