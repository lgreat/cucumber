<p class="bold">Dear GreatSchools Parent,</p>

<p>Thank you for filling out a parent survey about $SCHOOL_NAME on the GreatSchools Web site!  Parents regularly tell us how much they value this type of information.</p>

<p>As you know, test scores and other stats tell only part of the story about $SCHOOL_NAME.  Parent surveys bring your school to life on the GreatSchools Web site - but that's not the only way you can reach out to other parents!</p>

(If you have reviewed this school already, your new review will replace your older one.)</li>

<li><a href="$COMMUNITY_URL">Visit the GreatSchools Parent Community</a><br/>
Share your success stories, find answers to your questions about parenting and education and meet like-minded parents.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for helping parents understand more about $SCHOOL_NAME!</p>
