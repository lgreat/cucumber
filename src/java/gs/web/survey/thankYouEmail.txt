<p class="bold">Dear GreatSchools Parent,</p>

<p>Thank you for filling out a parent survey about $SCHOOL_NAME on the GreatSchools Web site!  Parents regularly tell us how much they value this type of information.</p>

<p>As you know, test scores and other stats tell only part of the story about $SCHOOL_NAME.  Parent surveys bring your school to life on the GreatSchools Web site - but that's not the only way you can reach out to other parents!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$PARENT_REVIEW_URL">Add your own Parent Review of $SCHOOL_NAME</a><br/>
(If you have reviewed this school already, your new review will replace your older one.)</li>
<li><p><a href="$CITY_LINK">Answer parent questions about local schools</a><br/>Help other parents by sharing your local knowledge in our Parent Community:</p>

</ul>

<p>See you soon,</p>

<p>GreatSchools</p>
