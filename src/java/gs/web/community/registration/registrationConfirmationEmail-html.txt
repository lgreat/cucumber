<h3>Welcome to GreatSchools!</h3>

<p>
Navigating your child's education can be a challenging job in endless ways. By pre-registering for the
GreatSchools community today, you've taken a step toward connecting with the more than 33 million parents
who turn to GreatSchools each year to help get a great education for their children!

We're building a dynamic set of features to help you meet parents, share your success stories, find
answers to your questions, advocate for local schools and more-and, as an early registrant, you'll
be among the first to be invited to join this exciting community of parents who are passionate about
education. Look for an official community invitation email in the coming weeks.
