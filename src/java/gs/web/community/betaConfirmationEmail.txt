Thanks for joining the GreatSchools Beta Group! Over the next year, we'll be launching<br/>
new features on GreatSchools, including powerful community features, exclusive school<br/>
ratings, and more!<br/>
<br/>
As a member of our beta group, you'll have the opportunity to take these new features<br/>
on a test drive - and tell us what you think about them.<br/>
<br/>
Here's how it works:<br/>
We'll notify you occasionally about new features before they're released. If you decide to<br/>
try them, we may ask you to fill out a short survey or provide us with feedback about your<br/>
experience after you're done. You'll have the opportunity to decide before each beta test<br/>
whether or not you'd like to participate.<br/>
<br/>
