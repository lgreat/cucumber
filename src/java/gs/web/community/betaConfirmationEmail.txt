Thanks for joining the GreatSchools Beta Group! Over the next year, we'll be launching
new features on GreatSchools, including powerful community features, exclusive school
ratings, and more!

As a member of our beta group, you'll have the opportunity to take these new features
on a test drive - and tell us what you think about them.

Here's how it works:
We'll notify you occasionally about new features before they're released. If you decide to try them, we may ask you to fill out a short survey or provide us with feedback about your experience after you're done. You'll have the opportunity to decide before each beta test whether or not you'd like to participate.
