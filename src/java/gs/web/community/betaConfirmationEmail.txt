Thanks for joining the GreatSchools Beta Group! Over the next year, we'll be launching<br/>
new features on GreatSchools, including powerful community features, exclusive school<br/>
ratings, and more!<br/>
<br/>
As a member of our Beta Group, you'll have the opportunity to take these new features<br/>
on a test drive - and tell us what you think about them.<br/>
<br/>
First we'd like to get to know you better: your interests, how you currently use<br/>
GreatSchools and your experience with online communities. It only takes a few minutes<br/>
and would really help us understand how we can build community features to best meet your needs!<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=709332289793">Fill out the survey</a><br/>
<br/>
Here's more detail on how the Beta Group works:<br/>
<ul>
<li>We'll notify you occasionally about new features before they're released.</li>
<br/>
<li>If you decide to try them, we may ask you to fill out a short survey or provide us<br/>
with feedback about your experience after you're done.</li>
<br/>
<li>You'll have the opportunity to decide before each beta test<br/>
whether or not you'd like to participate.</li>
</ul>
Thanks so much for your help! Together, we can build great tools for parents!<br/>
