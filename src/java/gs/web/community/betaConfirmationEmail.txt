<h3>Thanks for joining the GreatSchools Beta Group!</h3>

<p>Over the next year, we'll be launching new features on GreatSchools, including
powerful community features, exclusive school ratings, and more!</p>

<p>First we'd like to get to know you better: your interests, how you currently use
GreatSchools and your experience with online communities. It only takes a few minutes
and would really help us understand how we can build community features to best meet your needs!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=709332289793&c=$EMAIL">Fill out the survey</a></p>

<p>Here's more detail on how the beta group works:</p>
<ul>
<li>We'll notify you occasionally about new features before they're released.</li>
<br/>
<li>If you decide to try them, we may ask you to fill out a short survey or provide us<br/>
with feedback about your experience after you're done.</li>
<br/>
<li>You'll have the opportunity to decide before each beta test<br/>
whether or not you'd like to participate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, be sure to check out the GreatSchools Parent Community now to join an exciting
community of parents who are passionate about education.</p>
