Dear GreatSchools Parent,

Welcome to My School List, your personalized guide to schools! More than 35 million parents use GreatSchools each year to choose the right school for their child, track school performance and get expert advice to ensure their child's academic success.

My School List is just the beginning - there are other ways you can use GreatSchools to support your child's education:

* Meet parents ($CHOOSING_A_SCHOOL). Visit our parent community to talk to parents about finding the right school.

* Find support ($SCHOOL_CHOICE_CENTER). Identify what matters most when choosing a school for your child.

* Get expert advice ($NEWSLETTER_SUBSCRIBE). Sign up for free newsletters and manage your subscriptions.

Remember, you can review and update your My School List at any time: $MY_SCHOOL_LIST.

Best wishes,

GreatSchools

P.S. Have a great school year!
