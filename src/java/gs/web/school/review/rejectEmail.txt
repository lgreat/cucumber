Thank you for submitting a school review! School reviews are a way for parents, teachers, students, and anyone else who has had recent direct experience with a school to share what they liked or didn't like about it.

One reason GreatSchools is the most trusted resource for school information is that we publish both negative and positive reviews. It's important, therefore, that whatever you post on GreatSchools is in line with our school review guidelines at http://www.greatschools.org/cgi-bin/static/guidelines.html/ca

We ask that you be responsible and thoughtful when sharing your opinion, in keeping with our goal of making the GreatSchools community safe and civilized.

Reviews are monitored by a small group of moderators. Here are the primary reasons reviews are flagged as inappropriate and/or taken down. 

They contain:

-	Obscenities and hateful or other inappropriate language.
-	Accusations that someone has committed a crime.
-	Threats against the school, staff, or student body.
-	Negative statements about a specific teacher by name or other identifiable information.
-	Outdated or false information - for instance, the review is about a school your child never attended or has not attended in the past three years.
-	Insufficient information. Any review shorter than 10 words will be automatically rejected.



Thank you again for your submission. We hope you will consider reframing your review with our guidelines in mind so that other parents and students can benefit from your feedback.

Best regards,

The GreatSchools team
