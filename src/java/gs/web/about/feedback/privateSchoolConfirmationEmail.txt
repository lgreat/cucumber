<p>
Thank you for submitting information about a private school to GreatSchools.
We will post all verified information as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
PLEASE NOTE:
</p>

<p>
We receive updates to our private school information from the National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES) and from some state Departments of Education. To ensure that the school you
submitted stays on GreatSchools, please make sure it is listed with both of these entities;
otherwise, the school's profile will become inactive the next time we import private school data.
