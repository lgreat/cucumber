# NOTE: Every line starting with # is a comment
#       There must be only ONE line that is not a comment
#       Do not edit this file unless you know what you are doing
#       Always use the most reduced version of the ratio possible (e.g. 1/1 instead of 50/50)
#
# Common configurations:
#   A/B 50/50:      1/1
#   A/B 80/20:      4/1
#   A/B/C 70/15/15: 14/3/3
#
# Configuration is set as a ratio as follows
# Each number represents the ratio of that version occurring out of the sum of all versions.
# EXAMPLE:
#   14/3/3
#   This sums to 20. Version A will occur 14/20 (70%) of the time, version B 3/20 (15%), version C 3/20
#   Thus 14/3/3 is equivalent to A/B/C 70/15/15
#
# RESTRICTIONS:
#   - Each value must be in the range 1-99
#   - The sum of all values must be less than or equal to 100
#
1/1
